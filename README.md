An exploratory implementation of Blockchain Tech with Python.


Motivation
----------

1. I understand what problem Blockchains solve. I don't yet understand how.
2. People have ben pitching all kinds of stuff using blockchains left, right, and center. It would be nice to be able to tell which ones are hot air.
3. I might learn something which might benefit me.
4. It's always nice to know more about something which everyone cares about.

Since all the work is in the Notebook: [The Notebook](ToyCoin.ipynb)
